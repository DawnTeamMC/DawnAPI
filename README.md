The Dawn API is a library mod for the latest version of Minecraft that adds utility classes for constructing a typical mod for the Dawn Team.  
It is designed to be handy and ease with the creation of any feature in the game through builder classes, and a variety of tools for data fixing.

## Using Dawn API in your project

In order to use Dawn API as a library for your project, add the following in your ``build.gradle``:
```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }                // Required for Dawn API
    
    maven { url 'https://maven.shedaniel.me/' }       // Required for Cloth Config
    maven { url 'https://maven.terraformersmc.com/' } // Required for Mod Menu
    maven { url 'https://maven.ryanliptak.com/' }     // Required for AppleSkin
}

dependencies {
    modApi "com.github.DawnTeamMC:DawnAPI:v${dawn_version}"
}
```

Then, add the version in your ``gradle.properties``:
```properties
dawn_version = [VERSION]
```
Where [VERSION] is the version of Dawn API you want to use.

## üëæ Features
Other than being a useful API, the Dawn API is also bundled with some in-game tools too:

- `/health` - A command that allows easy control over an entity's health.
- `/foodbar` - A command that allows easy control over an entity's food/saturation points.
- `/motion` - A command that allows easy control over an entity's motion (velocity).
- `/export` - A command that can export information/files of the game's content.
- A custom TNT entity with more NBT data parameters than the vanilla TNT entity.
- A flying block entity which reflects the flying counterpart of the vanilla falling block entity.
