The Dawn API is a library mod for the latest version of Minecraft that adds utility classes for constructing a typical mod for the Dawn Team.  
It is designed to be handy and ease with the creation of any feature in the game through builder classes, and a variety of tools for data fixing.

**You can visit the [GitHub repository of the Dawn API for more information](https://github.com/DawnTeamMC/DawnAPI).**
