The Dawn API is a library mod that facilitates the creation of features for other mods. It also is bundled with some commands that can be used for mapmaking.

The Dawn API requires [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

The Dawn API is made for Fabric, and there are no plans to port it to Forge.
